sum-odd.c: Input some integers, and find the sum of the odd numbers among these integers. This activity was harder than previous labs, in the sense that this contained more moving parts than any of the practises before. I struggled especially with this one, not in terms of logic, but the really silly mistakes I made. For example, in the assigning to the array items part, I mistakenly kept it &arr[100] instead of &arr[i] (Still can't recover from the shock ðŸ™ˆ!). And I made a similar mistake in the bottommost loop, where the actual logic(sum of odd nums) was going on.

arr-checke-asc.c: Check if the numbers entered are in ascending order or not. The bulk of this code was directly copy-pasted from the previous program(the input taking logic), but when it came to the final logic(Checking if ascending), I wrote a code that worked, but looked horrible. In the sense that the final printf for announcing 
that the list is not ascending was 3 indentations deep, which is crazy to think about. Then I took some help from Pawan sir, and get rid of one level of if statements. Then I looked closer, and got rid of an else statement, until all that was left was very simple and readable code.
