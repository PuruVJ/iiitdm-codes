# 1.c - Compare sum of digits of one integer to another integer

Both integers had to be entered. This program was a little hard, because of the horrible silly mistakes I made(asking to enter value in `scanf` and `scanf` rather than `printf` and `scanf`), not initialising the sum variable, so it got filled with garbage values, and the results were coming out to be super-big numbers. I need to be more careful while writing code.

# 2.c - Decimal to Binary

This was also a bit challenging. Not b'coz the program itself is hard or anything, but b'coz my brain is still stuck in JS. For a minute I couldn't think anyway to do it in C. In JS, it's super easy to split a number into an array, and then just `map` over that array. SO this one took me a while, and I managed it.

So that's it :)
